Unit Testing: Writing unit tests to test individual units or components of code in isolation. These tests verify that each unit of code behaves as expected.

Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between multiple components or modules to ensure they work together correctly.

Functional Testing: Verifying that the software functions as expected from an end-user perspective. Functional tests cover specific features and functionalities of the application.

Regression Testing: Rerunning tests after code changes to ensure that the modifications haven't introduced new issues or broken existing functionality.

Automated Testing: Automating the execution of tests to improve efficiency and consistency. Automated testing is commonly used for unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests.

Manual Testing: Conducting manual testing by human testers to explore the application's behavior and identify any issues that automated tests might miss.

Code Reviews: Having peers review code changes to ensure adherence to coding standards, best practices, and identify potential issues.

Static Code Analysis: Using tools to analyze code for potential issues without executing it. Static code analysis helps identify coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Performance Testing: Evaluating how the software performs under different load conditions to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize performance.

Security Testing: Checking for security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's code and infrastructure.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conducting testing with end-users to ensure the software meets their requirements and expectations.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically integrating code changes and running tests on a shared repository multiple times a day to catch integration issues early.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploying code changes to staging and production environments after successful testing and approval.

Code Coverage Analysis: Measuring the percentage of code covered by tests to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

Monitoring and Logging: Implementing monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the application's behavior in production, aiding in debugging and issue resolution.

Quality Metrics: Establishing metrics to measure code quality and track improvements over time.

Bug Tracking and Issue Management: Using an issue tracking system to record, prioritize, and manage reported bugs and issues.
